# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis had a particularly outdated application that needed some security upgrades. They wanted us to address these issues by using Vulnerability Assessment charts, and dependency tests to upgrade their software.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing? I found the dependency check maven to be particularly helpful. Being able to immediately identify vulnerabilities, and their fixes is extremely helpful. It's important to code securely because new exploits are being introuduced every day. If we're not keeping up on our end, it's going to be a losing battle, and senstiive data could be at risk.


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I personally enjoy flowcharts, so it was nice having a step-by-step flowchart to help guide through a vulnerability assessment. It's much more intuitive than say: a list.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I found a lot of the vulnerabilities pertained to dependency issues, which are a huge source of exploitation if you're not ensuring that you're using the most up-to-date dependencies. In addition to the Assessment chart, I think keeping up with the dependency-check maven will prove to be an integral tool in all future software I create.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? We made sure it was a secure HTTPS protocol, and it correctly displayed our hash cipher through the local host. After refactoring, we can check in with the dependency-maven to ensure we haven't introduced and other exploits.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Definitely the dependency-check maven

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
This is the first pure security based course I've taken. Coding is a very popular field these days, and secure coding practices are often overlooked in the grand scheme of object oriented programming. Being able to demonstrate I'm capable of this verbally, and demonstratively is a huge skill to have.
